# AdventOfCode-2021

[AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is a christmas-themed coding challenge. There will be 2 puzzles each day, from the 1st to the 25th of December, with increasing difficulty each day.

This repository is set up as a platform to share our solutions, hopefully with a wide variety of languages and approaches.

Optionally, you can join our private Leaderboard with the code `1521326-1467fdf2` [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private).
