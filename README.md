# AdventOfCode-2021

[AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is a christmas-themed coding challenge. There will be 2 puzzles each day, from the 1st to the 25th of December, with increasing difficulty each day.

I solve the puzzles in `Dart` with focus on discovering the functional side of the language further.

I also created a handy starter project for anyone wanting to try the challenges in Dart. You can find it [here](https://github.com/S-ecki/AdventOfCode-Starter-Dart). It includes automatic input file download + parsing, boilerplate generation and helpful utility methods.
