# AdventOfCode-2021

[AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is a christmas-themed coding challenge. There will be 2 puzzles each day, from the 1st to the 25th of December, with increasing difficulty each day.

I solve the puzzles in `Dart` with focus on discovering the functional side of the language further.
